      <p>I love building <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-principles-of-adaptive-design/">adaptive</a>, 
      responsive sites with a strong focus on performance and accessibility. Using technologies including HTML, CSS/Sass/PostCSS and JavaScript. I  
      enjoy working with modern frameworks including <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and  
      <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> alongside front end tools and automation such as <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, 
      <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a>.</p>
      <p>I have over eight years agency experience (<a href="http://www.mzl.com">Mason Zimbler</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.brayleino.co.uk">Bray Leino</a>) working 
      with large clients including Microsoft, Toshiba, Samsung and AXA.</p>
      <p>I enjoy working closely with clients, mentoring and helping others, new technology research &amp; education, 
      UX/UI planning and prototyping and solution architecture.</p>
