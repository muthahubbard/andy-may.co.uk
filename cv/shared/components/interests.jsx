    return <section> <h2>Interests</h2> <p>I am a proud dad. A big sports fan, I love playing football and watching cricket. Also a bit of a foodie, always talking about meat and barbecuing, and have been known to get up in the middle of the night to light the smoker. I even handled the catering for the Bray Leino Bristol summer bbq, for around 70 people. More recently I have started working on a Bristol Burger app reviewing the local burger scene.</p></section>
